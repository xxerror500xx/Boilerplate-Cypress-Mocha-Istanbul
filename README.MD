## Unit tests with Cypress
The purpose of this project is to better understand the potential usage of Cypress for integration and Unit testing.

The Original:[ cypress-example-recipes
](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/tree/master/examples/unit-testing__application-code) inspired me to flesh out a simple dev build to see how one would incorporate integration tests and unit tests with cypress.

Wish list:
- "unitFolder" path config option in cypress.json
- A better debugging experience for unit tests. (might make a plugin for it?) Perhaps just a link to show function or diff of expected vs actual.
- (Cosmetic) Move unit tests to their own ul collapsible element at the cypress startup test selection window.
